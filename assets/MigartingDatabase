Try to recover the database via the link provided in parameter

If the database does not exist, the method will execute the code provided in the onCreate parameter

If the database exists, the method will check the version of the database and compare it with the version number provided as a parameter.

If the version of the database does not correspond to the version supplied as a parameter, the method will then execute the code of the onUpgrade parameters.

step 1
 - Maintain the text files for the queries you use for database, fileNaming convention can be something like this
    eg. from${oldVersionNumber}to${newVersionNumber}
 Note:- for the initial version you don't need create a file.

Step 2
 - Initial version to create a database

    /// It is used to get the current version number
        List<String> files = []; // initially it will be 0
     String query1 = "CREATE TABLE Company (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT)";
     var db = await openDatabase(
          path,
          version: files.length + 1, // 0 + 1 = 1
          onCreate: (db, version) async {
            await db.execute(query1);
            log('Table created');
          },
        );
